            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Since 1968, bone marrow transplants have been used to treat aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, lymphoma, immune deficiency disorders, and even cancer. It has given a new lease of life to many, but still continues to be an expensive medical procedure. Fundraising for bone marrow treatment provides an emergency solution here by helping raise small amounts of money from a large group of people who believe in your fast recovery. With crowdfunding affordable healthcare is just a few steps away. Pay your medication, surgery, hospital and post-op charges by raising the estimated amount. On Love Bonemarrow, people have previously raised funds for bone marrow transplant in days. You can too start a fundraiser in under five minutes and begin your journey of fundraising for bone marrow treatment.</p>
