            <h2>Why Your Support Matters</h2>
            <p>n India, around 112 million senior citizens face multiple social, psychological, economic and physical obstacles. Moreover, they also suffer from several health issues such as loneliness, elder abuse, neglect, lack of income, security and poor access to healthcare. Like our senior citizens who worked vigorously to keep us protected throughout our lives, the team at Ketto is at the forefront of supporting and sustaining the nursing homes in India. 

                As per the reports released by the Longitudinal Aging Study in India LASI, around 5% of people over 60 experience ill-treatment or no treatment at all. It includes both emotional and physical neglect leading to degradation in their health. Many elders, especially in rural areas, are left alone in the house while their children travel the world searching for food, shelter and jobs. 
                
                With so much happening in the world at the moment, the need to support old-age homes becomes imperative. What if we tell you that you can make a difference in their lives? Regardless of how big or small, your donation is, you can significantly change someoneâ€™s life for the better. </p>
