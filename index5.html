            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Becoming parents is an unworldly feeling that most couples wish to experience. The excitement that the entire household experiences when the news breaks that a couple is expecting a baby or babies is unmatched. Then starts the journey of taking utmost care of the mother, her nutrition, her fitness, mental health and of course, her cravings! No matter whatever is the financial situation in a household is, everyone tries their best to keep the expecting mother and the baby safe and healthy. Amidst all this excitement and care, it is most significant to have regular check-ups and ultrasound scans. 

 

                What you get to know through these ultrasound scans is to evaluate the infant's growth, determine whether multiple pregnancies are present, and detect any anomalies. Although the ultrasound scan is not 100% accurate, it has the advantages of being non-invasive, painless, and safe for both the mother and the unborn child. It helps to take important decisions within the time that can save a mother’s life as well. 
                
                 
                
                But unfortunately, there are times, when despite everything going smoothly with an expecting mother’s pregnancy, certain complications take place and in order to keep both the mother and the baby safe, a premature delivery occurs. Preterm babies, often have complex health problems, especially those who are delivered very early. Prematurity-related problems often differ.
