            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Early cancer tumor treatment is suggested by doctors to relieve any side effects and aggressive growth of cancer tumors. Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, Immunotherapy and Stem Cell Transplant are the most commonly recommended treatments, however, they are not always affordable. Expensive cancer treatment not only hampers your well-being but also proves to be fatal if not paid attention to on time. Crowdfunding for cancer can help you beat your disease by raising funds at the earliest. Receive help by raising small amounts from a large number of donors who are rooting for you during the most difficult time of your life with the help of a cancer fundraiser. PinkCober helps you share your story to potential donors around the world who will root for your cause and help you in your recovery.</p>
